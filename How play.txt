/!\ Please note that the first launch may take some time, as the script installs and/or updates what's needed to keep the game running correctly. /!\

If you are on Windows :
 - Go to the Windows launch folder, located here: /run/windows 
 - Launch the "play.bat" file by double-clicking on it (DON'T LAUNCH IN ADMINISTRATOR)
